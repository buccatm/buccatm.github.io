We have all been there before, you try to solve a problem but only make things worse. Then you spent hours Googling for potential solutions or clues. As a computer science student this occurs most often. If Google does not have your answer then it is time to ask for some help. As a Software Engineer asking smart questions is a must have ability. You can try to find your answer on Google or anywhere else on the web but at some point, you will need to ask someone for help. The most common open source community to ask for help pertaining to programming or hardware is Stack Overflow. But, be warned you must always try to ask smart questions or risk being ignored. So, exactly how does one create a smart question.

## What Makes A not Smart Question?
Now, it is tempting to just ask directly for a solution. But by doing so, you may be told to figured it out yourself or may not receive any response at all. This forum at Stack Overflow called, “python compound interest formula”, had been up for only a day and it just recently closed. No one even bothered to give any response. In this forum, it is formulated as a lazy question. It was almost as if the asker just copied and paste a homework problem and just expect for someone to give an answer. The problem was to create two functions that would use the given compound interest formula to perform an elementwise operation to generate a numpy array values. And it had to be done in python language. I do not have any experience with python, but the first thing I would have done if I were the asker is do some readings about the elementwise operations and numpy arrays. And then try to solve it myself. Only then I would have asked a question for any troubles I had followed by my understanding of the problem and my attempts to solve it. If the question were formulated like this, the user would have likely gotten some response.

## What Makes A smart Question?
A good question always shows your understanding and attempts in solving the problem. As Raymond states in his article: 
> The best way to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who just happens to need help on one particular problem.
>
So, before you ask your question, consider doing some readings related to the problem. Then create some potential solutions and test them. If all else fails, then it is time to create a smart question. Take this simple forum question called, “Array versus linked-list”. The question this person asked was, why would you use linked-list over array-list. This person implies that he or she had implemented both data structures and knows how implementing certain functions of a linked list and array list takes efforts. This question is a step up from the first question I had mentioned. As a result, this forum had about 34 responses answering this question. The general responses were time-complexity and preference of array-list over linked-list for certain projects or vice versa. So, what made this question much better than the first question? To me the biggest part was it is engaging and it helps the community. It is engaging because so many people took the time to respond to this question stating their opinions and facts. It helps the community because, this question will help anyone else who may have this question as well. Although this question is not a coding problem it is still a smart question.

## How Does Smart Questions make you Successful?
When it comes to programming there is always going to be some problems that will leave you stumped. The most obvious way to get an answer is through Google. If Google does not give you the answer you are looking for. The next thing you may want to do is to ask question. There are plenty of open source community in the web to ask for help. The most common place to go is Stack overflow. Stack overflow is the one of the best places to ask for questions relating to programming. However, do mind that asking for a question is not that simple. In fact, a single question is enough to make yourself look like a fool or an idiot. So, before you go ask your question, ask yourself, is it a smart question or a dumb question.
