Time flies by so fast. It feels like yesterday that I was a freshman learning to code with Java. Now here I am a junior, in a Software Engineering course learning how to professionally present myself to the world. And learning a brand-new language called JavaScript. Throughout the years I developed potential careers that I may pursue in the future. Although it still not set in stone, I am interested in designing video games and mobile application. And now a brand-new interest towards designing Websites. This Software Engineering course is perfect for me to develop skills towards my interests. 

My interest towards coding began with a curiosity of creating games.  I knew from the start about the complexity of creating those Triple A games or any games in general. But that did not stop me from to learning how to a create simple game with my first coding Language, Java. So why did I bother taking this course? Well besides the course being required, I hoped to gain the experience and the skill to become a software engineer. That first skill that I want to develop is learning how to collaborate with others. Throughout the years, I had mostly been coding for my assignments in C, C++, or java. The project was mostly done yourself and not with others. As for the games I tried to make, they can be easily done by yourself. So, I have little experience when it comes with group projects. As a software Engineer, its crucial to be able to work with others because on large projects it would be too handle alone.

Software Engineering is like a key for my three main interest. This course does not just teach Web design. It teaches the you how to become a professional programmer. Throughout this course you would develop the skills. And my expectation after this course is, I have not just learned Web design but to become a Software Engineer.
