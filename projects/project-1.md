This was the my project for ICS 212. This course enforced our data structure by using the C language and on unix. When I first learned this language the coding style was almost identical to Java. But I then realized that Java was actually built ontop of this language. The big difference between the two was the use of pointers and the use of memory. When I first learned java, I did not have to worry about memory or pointers. Another Challenge to the course was we did not use an IDE. We were introduced to unix. So in addition to learning C we also learned scripting on unix. This ment we had to create files to write out our program and do the linking and compiling ourselves by using the script commands. 

For this project it tested our knowledge of C and unix. The goal of this program was to implement a singly linked list ob bank records. The condition was while the program ran it must be able to allow a user to add a record, delete a record, print all of the record or just a specific record and delete a record. Then when the program closes those all data will be saved onto a file, where that file will be read when the program starts. So this ment that you will always start with some data. We also have to take account a user friendly interface.
