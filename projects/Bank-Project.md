summary: My First programing project using C language, unix Script commands, and makefiles.
---

This was the my project for ICS 212. This course enforced our data structure by using the C language and on unix. When I first learned this language the coding style was almost identical to Java. But I then realized that Java was actually built ontop of this language. The big difference between the two was the use of pointers and the use of memory. When I first learned java, I did not have to worry about memory or pointers. Another Challenge to the course was we did not use an IDE. Instead we were introduced to unix. So in addition to learning C we also learned scripting on unix. We had to create files to write out our program and do the linking and compiling ourselves by using the script commands.Taking this course taught me the behind the scene when I was programming Java in Eclipse.

For this project it tested our knowledge of C and unix. The goal of this program was to implement a singly linked list of bank records. The condition was while the program ran it must be able to allow a user to add a record, delete a record, print all of the record or just a specific record, delete a record and a quit. We did not implement any graphics, instead we used print to display the menue as the program ran. Then when the program closes all those data will be saved onto a file, where that file will be read when the program starts. So this ment that you will always start with some data. We also have to take account a user friendly interface.

Implementing this program taught us the importance of taking less time coding and more time creating a psuedocode. And when a bug occurs, instead of staring at the screen at trying to find the bug we would trace. These two things made it possible for me to create this programm with little issues.
