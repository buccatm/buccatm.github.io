summary: This is a continuation of ICS 212. This is the same Bank Record project as in project 1. But this time in C++ with additional functions/features added and new requirements.

Project 2 was the final project for ICS 212. The project is still the same with the same requirement, that is it be a singly linked list. However, the catch now is the whole program must be implemented in C++. Ontop that a recursive function was added to allow the user to put the entire list in reverse. The difference between C and C++ was like Java without the training wheels. C++ still had pointers but now classes were involved. 

Even though this project was almost identical to the previous project, I was still not able to just copy paste everything from C to this project. Almost all of the main functions had to be redone from scratch. This included the interface. For this project I had encountered more bugs than the previous project. Luckliy these bugs forced my program to crash. This may sound weird, but one thing I learned from this class is having a program crash is better than having in loop forver. There were lots of bug fixing in this project, but eventually I was able to get the program to work.

The biggest skill I learned from this project is time management. Coding everything the day before the deadline was just not practical and should always avoid. I would always spend each day coding one function at a time. This way I do not get overwhelmed and to avoid as much bugs as possible. This was the reason how I managed to get everything done on time with program working as it should.
